So if you want good steps for storing password:
1. Make a salt unique for each users ( create a salt column in your database )
2. Use bcrypt ( way slower than sha256 so it makes brute force very slow )
3. Right after you get the hash of password from plain password, set a random value in plain password variable so it's not longer in memory 
4. ( Optional ) store salt and / or passwords in a dedicated keyvault ( depending on ur infrastructure not always possible )
