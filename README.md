# Invite = [Invite Mazi to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=978163786886311977&permissions=93184&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.mazi.pw%2Fdiscordsuccess&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

# Website = [Mazi.pw](https://mazi.pw)

Here you can link your accounts so you can use the Mazi Bot. Accounts are required to use the Mazi bot. You may get an alert from Plex when linking about a "security alert", and it will show the server IP, this will be fixed eventually, but do not worry about it.

# How does this work?
1. First you connect your plex account with discord and choose which library you would like to share from.
2. Then when you and your friends want to watch a movie, you choose whether you want to make a poll to decide the movie or you search for a movie yourself.
3. The bot then automatically creates a watch together session with an invite link.
4. The bot then waits 10 minutes for everyone to join and lists how many users are in currently. 
5. Then after the 10 minutes, the movie or show automatically starts and then the user who owns the media can choose the controls.
