# Mazi
A discord bot to watch plex with your friends.

# As of 5/29/2022 this project has been archived.
I will eventually pick it up again. But currently the watch together feature (which is the main part of the bot) is so immature, it is impossible to get the data required to work with it. Around 30 or so hours have gone into this and it is really sad to see such a fun project be killed by something like an api. An issue has been made [here](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi/issues/951) if you want to check the status of this project. If the watch together api gets better and is workable, then I will unarchive this project and begin work on it again.

# How does this work?
1. First you connect your plex account with discord and choose which library you would like to share from.
2. Then when you and your friends want to watch a movie, you choose whether you want to make a poll to decide the movie or you search for a movie yourself.
3. The bot then automatically creates a watch together session with an invite link.
4. The bot then waits 10 minutes for everyone to join and lists how many users are in currently. 
5. Then after the 10 minutes, the movie or show automatically starts and then the user who owns the media can choose the controls.
